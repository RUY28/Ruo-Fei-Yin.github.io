Hi, I'm RuoFei Yin. I'm an incoming third year PhD student in Biostatistics at Graduate Schoole of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh under the guidance of [Dr. George Tseng](https://sites.pitt.edu/~ctseng/). I also worked as a graduate student researcher with [Dr. Colleen McClung](https://www.mcclung.pitt.edu/), [Dr. Marianne Seney](https://www.cnup.pitt.edu/people/marianne-seney) and [Dr. Kyle Ketchesin](https://www.cnup.pitt.edu/people/ant-237) at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh. I received my M.S. degree also in Biostatistics, University of Pittsburgh.

My current research lies at the intersection of statistical methodology and its interdisciplinary applications in biomedical research, with a broad goal of advancing health data science. I am interested in developing statistical models to remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity in bulk RNA-seq data. On the application side, I collaborated with researchers in psychiatry to analyze a wide range of omics and clinical data, particularly in circadian analysis, cell type deconvolution etc.
